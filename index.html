                    <p>Hello, I'm known as PinkKing and this is my site. Here you can find handtailored guides about the League of Legends and also what coaching services I offer.</p>
                    <details>
                        <summary>For more information about me</summary>
                        <p>I've been coaching players on League of Legends for a year and I've grown to really enjoy this proffesion. </p>
                        <p>I have experience in all aspects of the game that I gathered in over 4 years of being in the top 0.1% bracket of players on the ranked ladder. The service that I offer is proffesional, efficient and, most importantly, fun (since it's a game after all).</p>
                        <p>I also do coaching on proguides if you are interested in a more streamlined experience: <a href="https://www.proguides.com/coach/PinkKing" target="_blank">CLICK HERE</a></p>
